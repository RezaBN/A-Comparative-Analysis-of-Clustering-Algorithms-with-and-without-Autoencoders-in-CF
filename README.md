# A Comparative Analysis of Clustering Algorithms with and without Autoencoders in Collaborative Filtering
This repository implements the algorithms described in the paper "Improving Collaborative Filtering Performance: A Comparative Analysis of Clustering Algorithms with and without Autoencoders" which is now under review.

# Remark
 ***Upon acceptance of our paper, we will promptly share the implementation code and data.***
 
# Project Goals:

* Implement clustering algorithms for collaborative filtering (CF).
* Explore incorporating autoencoders to improve user/item representation before clustering.
* Compare the performance of these approaches using a benchmark dataset.

# Data:

 The repository will include scripts for loading and pre-processing a dataset suitable for CF tasks (e.g., user-item ratings).

# Code:

 Python code implementing various clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, FCM) for CF.
 Integration of autoencoders for dimensionality reduction and improved user representation.
 Evaluation metrics (e.g., recommendation accuracy, precision, recall) to compare the effectiveness of each approach.

# Results:

 The repository will include visualizations and analysis of the obtained results, comparing the performance of clustering with and without autoencoders.

# Contribution:
This project aims to contribute to the field of recommender systems by providing a comparative analysis of clustering techniques with and without autoencoders for CF tasks.

# Getting Started:
Upon acceptance of our paper, we will promptly share the implementation code and data. A README file will provide instructions on setting up the environment, running the code, and interpreting the results.
